Useful information regarding the cultist circle and cultist circle calculator (this app).

Cultist Circle Basic Rules:

For any given Cultist Circle Ritual, you must place between 1 and 5 items into the circle. It can be 5 of the same item or 5 different ones or any combination in between that.

When the ritual starts it will either be: 6 hours, 12 hours or 14 hours long.

The 12 hour one gives normal loot. This is the default ritual you get.

The 14 hour one gives "better" loot.

The 6 hour one gives you a chance at getting either Quest or Hideout items you still need. This is generally the one people want.

Which ritual you get depends on the value of the items you placed in the circle. The value used is the base value of the item, which is not the same as the buy/sell price. More on base values below.

To get a chance at the 14 hour ritual, you must put in at least 350,000 rubles worth of stuff into the circle.

To get a chance at the 6 hour ritual, you must put in at least 400,000 rubles worth of stuff into the circle.

Putting more than 400,000 worth of stuff will not increase your chance.

At 400,000(+) worth of stuff you have a 25% chance to trigger the 6 hour ritual, and a 75% chance to trigger the 14 hour one (and a 0% chance for the 12 hour one). However note that just because you got a 6 hour ritual does not guarantee that you will get a Quest or Hideout item you need, it's just a high chance you will. I believe to get specific quest items the quest must also be active on your character.

Calculating Base Value of Items:

To calculate the base value of an item: find how much it sells for at a vendor, and then divide that number by the vendor's Trading Multiplier. These multipliers are all listed here: https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Trading ).

Note: avoid using the Fence multiplier, his math seems off with respect to the other vendors and also doesn't line up with the values on the Cultist Circle Calculator. Not sure why, doesn't really matter either just don't use his numbers.

Example 1: a single bottle of Moonshine sells for 126,000 to Therapist.
Therapist has a trade multiplier of 0.63.
So the base value for Moonshine is: 126,000 / 0.63 = 200,000 rubles.

So this means that you'd need just two bottles of moonshine to get your cultist circle item value to the 400,000 threshold.

Example 2: an Antique Vase sells for 33,222 to Skier.
Skier has a trade multiplier of 0.49.
So the base value of an Antique Vase is: 33,222 / 0.49 = 67,800.

If you put five of those into the circle that would only add up to 339,000 so you'd get the 12 hour ritual.

However you could put one bottle of moonshine and three Antique Vases which would total: 403,400 and thus give you the 25% chance at the 6 hour ritual (and 75% chance at the 14 hour one).

Item Base Value:

The Cultist Circle Calculator also lets you lookup items directly and will tell you the base price of them. The PvE/PvP option on the calculator is to let it know which Flea Market to search items in (useful if you're directly buying the items to then put in your circle: you want to pay the least amount).
